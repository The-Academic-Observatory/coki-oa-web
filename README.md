# COKI Open Access Web
COKI Open Access Web is the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) based front end for the Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative's
Open Access Dashboard: [open.coki.ac](https://open.coki.ac/)

## OS pre-requisites
* Linux, Windows or MacOS.
* NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/
* yarn: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install
* Prettier code formatter: https://prettier.io/

## Preparing Data Files
The data for the COKI OA Website is generated by the [oa_web_workflow](https://github.com/The-Academic-Observatory/academic-observatory-workflows/blob/develop/academic_observatory_workflows/workflows/oa_web_workflow.py).
Apache Airflow workflow. This workflow needs to be run first to produce the data files that will be visualised by the 
website. Normally the following steps are performed automatically by the workflow when the website is built and 
deployed, however, during development this needs to be done manually.

Create a .env file in the root of the project, customising the path to point to the data folder output by the 
Airflow oa_web_workflow:
```bash
DATA_PATH=C:\path\to\oa_web_workflow_2022_02_01\build\data
```

Copy the following files and folders into the `public` directory:
* `oa_web_workflow_2022_02_01\build\data\logos` -> `coki-oa-web\public\logos`
* `oa_web_workflow_2022_02_01\build\data\autocomplete.json` -> `coki-oa-web\public\data\autocomplete.json`
* `oa_web_workflow_2022_02_01\build\data\country.json` -> `coki-oa-web\public\data\country.json`
* `oa_web_workflow_2022_02_01\build\data\institution.json` -> `coki-oa-web\public\data\institution.json`

## Running Development Server
Run the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Build & Deploy
Build site:
```bash
yarn build
```

Export site:
```bash
next export
```

Customise your wrangler.toml file, see wrangler.toml.example:
```toml
name = "coki-oa-web"
type = "webpack"
account_id = "my-cloudflare-account-id"
zone_id = "my-cloudflare-zone-id"
compatibility_date = "2022-02-03"

[site]
bucket = "out"
entry-point = "workers-site"

[env.dev]
workers_dev = true

[env.staging]
workers_dev = true

[env.prod]
route = "my-production-domain/*"
```

Deploy to develop:
```bash
wrangler publish -e dev
```

Deploy to staging:
```bash
wrangler publish -e staging
```

Deploy to production:
```bash
wrangler publish -e production
```

## Configuring Github Actions
The following Github Secrets need to be created:

* GCP_CREDENTIALS: credentials for gsutil.
* BUCKET_NAME: the name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket that contains the data files.
* WRANGLER_CONFIG: the Cloudflare Wrangler configuration file.
* CF_API_TOKEN: the Cloudflare API Token.

See below for instructions on how to set these up.

### wrangler.toml
See the wrangler.toml.example file for an example of how to create the wrangler.toml file.

Add the file to the WRANGLER_CONFIG Github Secret.

### Cloudflare API Token
This connection contains Cloudflare API token that enables Wrangler to publish the Open Access Website to Cloudflare.
See [Cloudflare Creating API tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/tokens/create) for instructions on how to
create a Cloudflare API token. The Cloudflare API token is already URL encoded. The required settings for the token are
listed below.

Permissions:
* Account, Workers KV Storage:Edit
* Account, Workers Scripts:Edit
* Account, Account Settings:Read
* User, User Details:Read
* Zone, Workers Routes: Edit

Account Resources:
* Include, <select your account>

Zone Resources:
* Include, Specific zone: <select the domain you will deploy to>

```yaml
cloudflare_api_token: http://:<cloudflare_api_token>@
```
